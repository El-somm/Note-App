6. Explanation of personal difficulties and lessons learnt

One of the first difficulties I encountered was file organization and management. I struggled many times with errors due to improper routing and folder/file arrangement, which led me to restart the project entirely out of frustration. Another issue I encountered was memoryâ€”I really struggled with remembering what to do next and what tasks I had to complete, often turning to ChatGPT for guidance. I had some difficulties connecting to MongoDB, but I eventually connected directly through VS Code without any issues. I encountered many syntax errors and often got frustrated, but I reminded myself to take a breath, take a break, and review the code with a calm mind.

This project made me realize that I need a lot more practice, and I hope to create more projects similar to this one in my spare time to continue growing my development skills and understanding.
